          <h2>Introductions</h2>

<p><img src="http://thepatrick.cachefly.net/about/4/ofme.jpg" width="218" height="152" alt="Me" style="display: block; margin:  11px 30px 19px 0; border: 0; float: left;" /></p>

<p>I am a 25 year old guy who is currently working in Sydney, Australia.
Opinions expressed around here are, of course, my own.</p>

<p><strong>People</strong>. I could not be a hermit that lived completely disconnected from other people. I think that is what turned me to the internet, and my technical inclination brought having a website to the front of my mind as being the most logical way of connecting with other people.</p>

<p><strong>Computers</strong>. I can not imagine my life without the influence they have had. I am not strongly defensive of any platform over another - though I can not deny that Mac OS X is my favourite. I value open source, because I believe it is a viable way of building software. I value commercial applications, because if it truely is good, and someone wants to be paid for it, then it is worth paying for. (Check out the current <a href="http://soapbox.co.nz/past/2006/11/23/toolkit/">software toolkit</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Photography</strong>. It's a relatively low priority passion,
but I think I'm getting better. All the photos you see on this site were
taken by me. This has some definite advantages (for one I can allow myself
to use my photos for anything I like).</p>

<p><strong>Creative Commons</strong>. You'll notice at the bottom of the
page a link to <a href="http://soapbox.co.nz/rights-reserved">Some Rights Reserved</a>. I strongly believe that content we
(all humans) create should first and foremost be usable to encourage further creation.
As such I license my content under a creative commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
2.0" license, and most photographs (on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pftqg">flickr</a>) from 2007 onwards under
an creative commons Attribution 2.5 licence - feel free to use it. Code is,
where possible, given away under a BSD-style license. (The source code for this
website is available on <a href="http://github.com/thepatrick/websites/tree/master/thepatrick.com.au/">github</a>.)</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>Where do I see myself in one year? I don't know. Right here in Australia,
seeing the landscape and taking photos wherever I can. Hopefully
finding food too.</p>

<p>In 10 years? In a stable job, that I enjoy, earning enough money to
keep myself happy. Much more than that I do not know. What I
will be doing to earn that money, where I will be living, what I
will do in my spare time, I can not even begin to speculate on.</p>

<p>How can I accurately describe myself on a page which doesn't show emotion? I can not. Perhaps what you have read above will give you a glimpse at the person who has written the code here, the person who writes in the blog. The person behind the pictures you see on Flickr.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,<br/>
Patrick.</p>
