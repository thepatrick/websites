I am a 26 year old guy who is currently working in Sydney, Australia.

I use Macs, I code in Ruby on Rails, Javascript and Objective-C. I avoid
most other programming languages except C, and occasionally Java when 
Android is unavoidable. I have on occasion used Python. I promised myself
never again. I renegged on that once. I hope not to again.

You'll notice at the bottom of the 
page a link to [Some Rights Reserved][rights]. I strongly believe that content we 
(all humans) create should first and foremost be usable to encourage further creation. 
As such I license my content under a creative commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 
2.0" license, and most photographs (on [flickr][flickr]) from 2007 onwards under 
an creative commons Attribution 2.5 licence - feel free to use it. Code is, 
where possible, given away under a BSD-style license. (The source code for this
