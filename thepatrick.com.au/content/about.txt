Introductions
-------------

I am a 25 year old guy who is currently working in Sydney, Australia. 
Opinions expressed around here are, of course, my own.

**People**. I could not be a hermit that lived completely disconnected from other people. I think that is what turned me to the internet, and my technical inclination brought having a website to the front of my mind as being the most logical way of connecting with other people.

**Computers**. I can not imagine my life without the influence they have had. I am not strongly defensive of any platform over another - though I can not deny that Mac OS X is my favourite. I value open source, because I believe it is a viable way of building software. I value commercial applications, because if it truely is good, and someone wants to be paid for it, then it is worth paying for. (Check out the current [software toolkit][toolkit].)

**Photography**. It's a relatively low priority passion, 
but I think I'm getting better. All the photos you see on this site were 
taken by me. This has some definite advantages (for one I can allow myself 
to use my photos for anything I like).

**Creative Commons**. You'll notice at the bottom of the 
page a link to [Some Rights Reserved][rights]. I strongly believe that content we 
(all humans) create should first and foremost be usable to encourage further creation. 
As such I license my content under a creative commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 
2.0" license, and most photographs (on [flickr][flickr]) from 2007 onwards under 
an creative commons Attribution 2.5 licence - feel free to use it. Code is, 
where possible, given away under a BSD-style license. (The source code for this
website is available on [github][gh].)

The future
----------

Where do I see myself in one year? I don't know. Right here in Australia, 
seeing the landscape and taking photos wherever I can. Hopefully 
finding food too.

In 10 years? In a stable job, that I enjoy, earning enough money to 
keep myself happy. Much more than that I do not know. What I 
will be doing to earn that money, where I will be living, what I 
will do in my spare time, I can not even begin to speculate on.

How can I accurately describe myself on a page which doesn't show emotion? I can not. Perhaps what you have read above will give you a glimpse at the person who has written the code here, the person who writes in the blog. The person behind the pictures you see on Flickr.

Thanks for reading,  
Patrick.
