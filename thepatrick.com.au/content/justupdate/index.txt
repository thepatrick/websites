	If you're like me you get your twitter updates on the go via SMS, but you have to pay
	to send SMS back to twitter. You might even be slightly bitter about this. So all you
	want in a web app is an update field, and perhaps a counter of remaining characters,
	one that if the update fails won't lose your text.

	Provided free of charge, so do what you want with it, just don't blame me when you 
	accidentally cause a meltdown of a nuclear reactor. Please. Any questions, complaints, death
	threats, just <a href="/make-contact.html">contact me</a>.
