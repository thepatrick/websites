<p>
	<strong>The web version of JustUpdate is no longer available</strong> due 
	to the discovery of a potential security vulnerability. With more features,
	yet still very compact, an iPhone/iPod app is now available.
</p>


<p><big><strong><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288653494&amp;mt=8">Get JustUpdate from the AppStore</a>.</strong></big></p>

<p>
	Provided free of charge, so do what you want with it, just don't blame me when you 
	accidentally cause a meltdown of a nuclear reactor. Please. Any questions, complaints, death
	threats, just <a href="http://patrick.geek.nz/contactme">contact me</a>.
